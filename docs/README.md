> Squeleto is an simple 2d game framework built in Typescript and powered by Vite.

Squeleto is a spin off of 'Skeleton' in spanish. 'El Squeleto' as a library is intended to provide a highlevel skeleton or abstraction
for your game development needs.

## Peasy

Squeleto uses the peasy-lib framework to run many of the low level processes, including Asset management, UI binding, Input action
binding, Game Loop, and in the future, will be a physics module and lighting module.

## Basic and Advanced

Squeleto has a very rudementary library with a simple gameloop and GameObjects. But the latest version of Squeleto introductes the
Entity,Component, System (ECS) version of Squeleto. This is very exciting, while the ECS setup has less 'out-of-the-box' ready to go
setup, it has the highest extensibility, as you can customize and tailer your enities however you want.
